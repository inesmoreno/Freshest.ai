 *Banana*

Counter | Refrigerator | Freezer
---|---|---
2-7 Days |	2-9 Days |	2-3 Months

* How to tell if Bananas are bad, rotten or spoiled?

Fresh bananas will first get brown spots and then get soft and turn completely brown and leak liquid when they have gone bad. If left out long enough they will eventually turn black and grow mold. Bananas are usually shipped green since they develop better color, texture, aroma and sweet taste after being harvested. Placing bananas near other fruit will cause the other fruits to also ripen faster.

Another problem you may experience with having fresh fruit on the counter is the sudden presence of fruit flies. Fruit Flies are tiny little flies that just hover around your fresh fruit basket. So, how do you get rid of fruit flies? To get rid of fruit flies, place a bowl of water with a teaspoon of vinegar in it next to the fruit basket at night. In the morning, all the fruit flies will have taken their final swim in the bowl.

* How to store Bananas to extend their shelf life?

Bananas ripen at room temperature, so to stunt the ripening process bananas can be placed in the refrigerator. To extend the shelf life of bananas at room temperature, place plastic wrap tightly around the stem of the bunch. Bananas can also be frozen, but the texture will change.

If you find your bananas have turned brown, try to make banana bread!


*Avocado*

(Unopened) | Shelf |	Fridge
---| ---| ---
Fresh |	3-4 Days | 7-10 Days
Homemade Guacamole | 3-4 Hours | 1-2 Days

* How to tell if Avocados are bad, rotten or spoiled?

A perfect avocado is a dark green color and the avocados firmness will give just a little when pressed. An avocado has most probably gone bad when it is black and you can leave an indent in the avocado with a gentle press of your finger. A good avocado is a light green color when cut open and an avocado that has gone bad will be brown or even black on the inside of the avocado. So, before this happens to your avocado you better know how to guacamole.

* How to store Avocados to extend their shelf life?

Even though avocados are actually fruit, they are best kept in the refrigerator drawer that is marked for fresh produce. Once avocados are ripe, keeping them in the refrigerator will make them last several days longer. If they are left on the counter, they will continue to ripen. If your avocado is not yet ripe, you can spidden the process by:
1. Store the avocados in a paper bag to contain the gases and thus speed the ripening process. You can also ripen different kinds of fruits within the same paper bag. Bananas and Avocados together in a paper bag will both ripen faster. (never use plastic)
2. Wrap it tightly in tin foil and then place it in a warm (200°) oven for 10-15 minutes. This will soften the avocado, but it is cooked rather than naturally ripened and the taste is slightly altered.
3. If you are in a pinch and really want guacamole but your avocados are still firm, then bring out your blender or food processor. Add some defrosted frozen peas to the mixture before blending to add creaminess. Chances are you won’t notice any change in taste, unless maybe if you despise peas.

Guacamole!
